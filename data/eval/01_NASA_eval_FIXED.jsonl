{"question": "What does the standard require regarding cleanliness of assembled coaxial connectors?", "ground_truth_context": ["c141"], "ground_truth_answer": "Assembled coaxial connectors shall not have accumulated contaminants; they shall be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, water, or a combination until contaminants have been removed."}
{"question": "For manual crimping tools, what feature is required to prevent premature tool opening?", "ground_truth_context": ["c112"], "ground_truth_answer": "A full-cycle ratcheting mechanism."}
{"question": "According to the definitions, what is a ferrule?", "ground_truth_context": ["c22"], "ground_truth_answer": "A short metal tube used to make crimp connections (e.g., to shield wires or terminate braid)."}
{"question":"According to the definitions section, what does “Certification” mean in this standard?","ground_truth_context":["c21"],"ground_truth_answer":"Certification. The act of verifying and documenting that personnel have completed required training, have demonstrated specified proficiency, and have met other specified requirements."}
{"question": "Summarize the key design parameters for mockups and wiring boards used to route and build harnesses.", "ground_truth_context": ["c40"], "ground_truth_answer": "Use a full-sized, three-dimensional fixture or wiring board with fixed termination points and features that simulate the hardware. Materials shall support wiring/harnessing and shall not leave contaminating residue."}
{"question": "Summarize the general design provisions for interconnecting harnesses in Section 7.1.1.", "ground_truth_context": ["c32"], "ground_truth_answer": "Harness design shall provide for project performance and reliability, including installation, inspection, test, maintenance, and removal. Provisions include features such as confidence loop circuits to verify proper mating."}
{"question": "Summarize the general test points for dielectric/insulation tests on an interconnecting cable or harness assembly.", "ground_truth_context": ["c150"], "ground_truth_answer": "Apply tests across (1) each conductor to every other conductor, (2) each conductor to the connector body/shell, and (3) between shields, as specified."}
{"question": "Summarize the guidance for installing metal braid shielding over a harness.", "ground_truth_context": ["c72"], "ground_truth_answer": "Metal braid shielding may be woven directly over a harness or applied as prewoven braid. Where used, prewoven metallic braid shall be cleaned prior to installation (per Chapter 15)."}
{"question": "Which cleaning solvents are specified for assembled coaxial connectors?", "ground_truth_context": ["c141"], "ground_truth_answer": "Isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, water, or a combination thereof, used until contaminants are removed."}
{"question": "What are the differences in use cases between a lap splice and a butt splice?", "ground_truth_context": ["c154", "c206"], "ground_truth_answer": "A lap splice joins conductors in parallel and is often used for wire-size limitations or to terminate an RFI/EMI shield; a butt splice joins conductors end-to-end and provides a very small-diameter profile when installed in a harness."}
{"question": "Compare spiral wrap sleeving and metal braid shielding in terms of allowed usage and preparation.", "ground_truth_context": ["c68", "c72"], "ground_truth_answer": "Spiral wrap sleeving is prohibited on mission-critical or flight hardware (including launch vehicles), while metal braid shielding is allowed; prewoven braid shall be cleaned before installation (per Chapter 15)."}
{"question": "How do lacing requirements differ between small breakouts and large breakouts?", "ground_truth_context": ["c46", "c58"], "ground_truth_answer": "For single or small multiple breakouts, cross-over lockstitches across the breakout are not required and running lockstitches on each side may be used; large breakouts require specific lacing with starting/ending stitches placed on each side of the breakout."}
{"question": "When securing braided sleeving over a bundle, how do lacing and plastic straps compare, and what constraints apply to straps?", "ground_truth_context": ["c60", "c70"], "ground_truth_answer": "Braided sleeving can be secured using lacing, spot ties, cable straps, clamps, or heat-shrink sleeving; plastic straps, if used, shall be locked to prevent loosening (and installed per the standard’s strap placement/cut guidance)."}
